# NeuralNetOptimizer
Also known as, "AutoArchitect," "NeuralSearch," or "MLOptimizer."
NeuralNetOptimizer is a TensorFlow-based program that automatically optimizes the architecture of neural networks. It uses techniques such as neural architecture search, reinforcement learning, or evolutionary algorithms to iteratively search for the best architecture for a given task, and uses TensorFlow to train and evaluate different architectures.

This program can be used to improve the performance of various machine learning applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, or predictive modeling. It can also be used to accelerate the development of new machine learning models, by automating the process of finding optimal architectures.

Installation
To install NeuralNetOptimizer, you will need to have Python and TensorFlow installed on your system. You can install Python from the Python website or using a package manager such as pip. TensorFlow can be installed using pip by running the following command:

pip install tensorflow
You can then download or clone the NeuralNetOptimizer repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuralnetoptimizer.git
cd neuralnetoptimizer
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use NeuralNetOptimizer, you will need to provide it with input and output data for a given machine learning task. You can then call the optimize method to search for the optimal architecture for the task, and the train and evaluate methods to train and evaluate the final model.

Here is an example of how to use NeuralNetOptimizer to train a model for image classification:

import tensorflow as tf
from neuralnetoptimizer import NeuralNetOptimizer

# load input and output data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# create NeuralNetOptimizer object
optimizer = NeuralNetOptimizer((x
